# NLP-LDA with Stochastic Optimization  
This folder contains a course final project of Advanced Information Retrieval.  
In this project, we modify online variational Bayes LDA and compare it with the original one (Hoffman et al. 2010) and online LDA with infinite vocalbulary (Zhai and Boyd-Graber 2013) with respect to perplexity, PMI co-occourance statistic and topic based similartiy.  
We use the DBLP data set for our simulation. This data set is available on http://dblp.uni-trier.de/ .
